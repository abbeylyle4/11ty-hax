<h3>VS Code</h3>
<p>VS code is a code editing software that comes in handy when learning JavaScript. It provides support for debugging and version control. It is a great option for beginners who are getting into web dev.

<h3>Node JS</h3>
<p>NodeJS is an open source platform and allows you to run server-side applications on your personal machine.

When downloading, make sure that you download the LTS/"recommended for most users" option for a more reliable platform.

**Tip**: to double check that NodeJS has installed successfully, you can simply type `node` in your terminal window (for macOS users, you can navigate to it by searching 'terminal' in your launchpad)
</p>
<h3>NPM</h3>  
<p>
Luckily for you, npm (node package manager) is installed as a _package deal_ with NodeJS. Npm is the default package manager for NodeJS and allows you to use third party code in your own. It is one of the largest software registries, giving you a plethora of tools for your own code.

Similarly to NodeJS, you can ensure you have npm by typing `npm` in your terminal window. You will see a longer message this time showing some of the capabilities you have with npm!
